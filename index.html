		<h2 class="header_red">Hello, World!</h2>
		<p>This is an attempt at twee tech humour, a personal homepage parodically styled after the Apache2 Debian Default Page. Normally, if you saw a page that looks like <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apache2_Debian_default_page.png">this</a>, it would mean that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site was working properly. An administrator would replace this file (located at <code>/var/www/html/index.html</code>) before continuing to operate their HTTP server. </p>
		<p>This webpage's primary objective is simply <strong>to occupy the index location for this domain</strong>. Beyond the original after which this page is styled, this website uses responsive layouts and adjusts its colour palette to your device's preferred colour scheme; light or dark. As you are assumedly a <em>human user</em> if you are reading this, thank you for showing an interest. </p>

		<p>The technical skill dictionary for robSafar is as follows: </p>
		<pre>robSafar_technical_skills = {
	"Google Analytics": ["extensive", "professional"]
	"Google Tag Manager": ["intermediate", "professional"]
	"Google Looker Studio": ["intermediate", "professional"]
	"CRM systems": ["intermediate", "professional"]
	"HTML": ["extensive", "professional"]
	"CSS": ["intermediate", "professional"]
	"JavaScript": ["beginner", "amateur"]
	"Linux CLI": ["intermediate", "amateur"]
	"Python": ["intermediate", "training"]
	"R": ["intermediate", "training"]
	"SQL": ["beginner", "training"]
	"Ruby": ["beginner", "professional"]
	"PHP": ["beginner", "amateur"]
}</pre>
		<ul>
			<li>Items specifying <code>"professional"</code> in their definition lists are skills that have been applied and added value in an operational context. </li>
			<li>All <code>"professional"</code> skills have also included some <code>"training"</code>, or at least having read some documentation. </li>
			<li>Skill levels cross the <code>"beginner"</code> threshold when they have been applied in a non-trivial context. For example, in the case of <code>Ruby</code> experience has been in the use of <em>Liquid Tags</em> for front-end templating in Jekyll and NationBuilder. </li>
			<li><strong>This dictionary is non-exhaustive</strong>. robSafar can also prepare edible foodstuffs at an intermediate level and has an okay eye for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/robsafar">photography</a>. Additional soft skills are best experienced subjectively. </li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="header_grey">Document Access</h2>
		<p>By default, robSafar does not allow access through the web browser to his expansive and valuable datasets on future events. These are protected by both an air gap and <em>time</em> gap, whereby they have been delivered to the future where they will be re-transcribed after the events to which they pertain. </p>
		<p>The default method to access these is via symlink to the future state of your machine where the datasets will be kept once you have obtained them. </p>
		<h2 class="header_grey">Reporting Problems</h2>
		<p>The <a href="https://github.com/robSafar/robSafarDotCom">repository for this page</a> is public on GitHub where the website is also hosted. Feel free to submit an issue or pull request. </p>
		<p>Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others) to respective packages, not to the web server itself. </p>
